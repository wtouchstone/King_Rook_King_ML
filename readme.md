To run this code, use the following arguments:
The first command line argument will be one of three:
    -bagging: use random forest with bagging classification
    -svm: use SVM with a nonlinear kernel classification
    -nn: use neural network classification
The second command line argument dictates whether to perform a Cross Validation:
    -0: do not run crossval on train_x data
    -1: run crossval on train_x data
The third commandline argument dictates whether or not to train, then predict, the calculate score
    -0: it doesn't
    -1: it does this

THIS CODE REQUIRES SCIKIT AND NUMPY. Simply install these through pip and you should be good
Runs on Python 3.7+

This code does not ouput graphs. It will output the raw numbers that I used to construct my graph (for bagging)
and the data that fills the tables for SVM and NN. The code defaults to 50% training data and 50% testing data
unless the code is modified. I had to do this to have any semblance of realistic training times.
